      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born
        October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong),
        Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the
        development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In
        1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was
        project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that
        was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam
        planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
        helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was
        Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
        incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
